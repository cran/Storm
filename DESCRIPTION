Description: Storm is a distributed real-time computation system. Similar to how
 Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm
 provides a set of general primitives for doing real-time computation.
 .
   Storm includes a "Multi-Language" (or "Multilang") Protocol to allow
 implementation of Bolts and Spouts in languages other than Java.  This R
 extension provides implementations of utility functions to allow an application
 developer to focus on application-specific functionality rather than Storm/R
 communications plumbing.
